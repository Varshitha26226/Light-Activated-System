# Light-Activated-System

This project uses an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) to detect ambient light and control an LED accordingly. Built using Arduino Uno and simulated on Wokwi.

# Components
- Arduino Uno
- LDR sensor
- LED
- 220Ω resistor

# Logic
- If light is low (LDR value < 500), LED turns ON
- If light is bright, LED turns OFF

# Simulation
Run and test this project on [Wokwi Simulator](https://wokwi.com/projects/440177522945167361)
